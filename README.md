# htmltoys

Small and self-contained HTML5 canvas toys. 

Each toy comes in a single, self-contained .html file. The source never exceeds a few hundred lines and should be easy to follow. Its plain HTML and Javascript. This means that all toys can be opened locally from you hard disk without any CORS issues or the likes (with the only exception of "Phase space", because that one plays music from an external file).

## The toys

**[Apfelberge](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/apfelberge.html)**

Draw a Julia set like its 1987!

**[vidfx](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/vidfx.html)**

Some camera video effects. Launch [vidfx.html?facingMode=environment](https://386dx25.de/vidfx.html?facingMode=environment) for other camera.

**[ASCII Patterns](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/ascii-patterns.html)**

Stupid ASCII pattern generator.

**[Circle Flow Animation](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/circleflow-animation.html)**

Animation of Circle Flow ;-)

**[Circle Flow](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/circleflow.html)**

Two flow fields interpolated at 10 steps and applied to a circle.

**[XorXor](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/xorxor.html)**

Generative Christmas cards 2023.

**[Archimedes Hat](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/hat.html)**

Is this the hat of Archimedes?

**[Winiarski](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/winiarski.html)**

Interactive game as a homage to Ryszard Winiarski (1936 - 2006).

**[Saturn](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/saturn.html)**

Non-interactive size-coding; based on Minsky's HAKMEM circle algorithm. 
The source is basically a dweet player. See [my original dweet on dwitter](https://dwitter.net/d/26001).

**[Infiniballs](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/balls.html)**

Interactive animation of an infinite number of balls at constant cost.

Comes with three presets:

- ["hue"](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/balls.html?style=rainbow&mode=linear) in rainbow color (*interactive, follows mouse click / touch*)
- ["bw"](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/balls.html?style=bw&mode=clelia) draws a Clelia curve
- ["city"](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/balls.html?style=bw&mode=manhattan) only allows right angle turns
- ["nmi"](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/balls.html?style=nmi&mode=nmi) is a homage to [Jump from Public Enemy (1992)](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=4210) (see [video of original effect](https://youtu.be/DNpw4xrR_Bc?t=28))

**[sinescans2](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/sinescans2.htm)**

Interactive animation. See also the [first version](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/sinescans.htm).

> I love 1980's style 2D function plot algorithms; this one draws column wise using a 1-value z-buffer for hidden line removal ;-)

**[Chladni flower](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/chladflow.html)**

Interactive animation of a raycasted sphere, deformed by integrating a sinusoid velocity field. Instead of just adding displacements, a vectorfield is integrated. By this little trick very large deformations can be applied at good quality. 
The source is basically a minimal shadertoy player. See [my original version on shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3dS3zV).)

**[Hypnotoads pixel disco](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/pixeldisco.htm)**

Interactive animation. Try out the following preset kernels or paint your own:

- [box kernel preset](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/pixeldisco.htm?kernel=box&con=1111) 
- [cross kernel preset](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/pixeldisco.htm?kernel=cross&con=1111)

![Screenshot of Hypnotoads pixel disco](img/screenshots/pixeldisco.jpg)

**[Phase space](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/phasespace/phasespace.html)**

Music visualization after Monro and Pressing 1998.  This was once a new years greeting. Press pause at the right moment to find a nice shape defined by the sound wave. The music is a very old recording of me and my e-guitar. (Phase space is currently the only toy spread across multiple files. A single .html file version + .ogg music is in preparation.)

![Screenshot of Phase space](img/screenshots/phasespace.jpg)

**[Serendipitous circles](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/serendipitous.htm)**

Interactive pattern generator, basically a port of a the "Serendipitous circles" article in Byte magazine from 1977. (Again based on Minsky's HAKMEM circle algorithm).

![Screenshot of Serendipitous circles](img/screenshots/serendipitous.jpg)

**[decoherence](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/decoherence.html)**

Interactive animation.

**[10print](https://shermnonic.github.io/htmltoys/10print.html)**

(Notorious.)

![Screenshot of my version of the classic 10print](img/screenshots/10print.jpg)
